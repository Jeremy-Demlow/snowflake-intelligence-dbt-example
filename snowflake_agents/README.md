# Snowflake Agents Management

This directory manages Snowflake Intelligence Agents independently from the dbt data pipeline.

## Why Separate from dbt?

Agents are **operational entities** that:
- Can have tools added/removed dynamically
- Need configuration updates independent of data models
- Have different deployment lifecycles than data transformations
- Require operational management (start/stop/modify)

## Usage

### Deploy Agents
```bash
# Generate SQL from YAML configs
python agent_generator.py

# Deploy specific agent
snow sql -f generated/acme_intelligence_agent.sql

# Deploy enhanced agents
snow sql -f generated/acme_contracts_agent_enhanced.sql
snow sql -f generated/acme_intelligence_agent_enhanced.sql
```

### Generate Enhanced Agents
```bash
# Generate enhanced agents
python agent_generator.py --agent acme_contracts_agent_enhanced
python agent_generator.py --agent acme_intelligence_agent_enhanced

# List available configurations
python agent_generator.py --list
```

### Agent Management
```bash
# Check deployed agents
snow sql -q "USE DATABASE SNOWFLAKE_INTELLIGENCE; USE SCHEMA AGENTS; SHOW AGENTS;"

# Test agent functionality
snow sql -q "DESC AGENT SNOWFLAKE_INTELLIGENCE.AGENTS.ACME_CONTRACTS_AGENT;"
```

## 🚀 Production-Grade Agent Patterns (Enhanced)

Based on analysis of enterprise Snowflake agent deployments, we've identified key patterns for production-grade performance:

### Performance Optimization Patterns

**❌ Basic Orchestration:**
```yaml
orchestration: "Use this tool for X and that tool for Y"
```

**✅ Production Orchestration:**
```yaml
orchestration: >
  OVERALL: parallelize as many tool calls as possible for optimal latency.
  Use multiple tools simultaneously for comprehensive analysis.
```

### Executive Response Structure

**✅ Production Pattern:**
```yaml
response: >
  Transform analysis into executive-ready insights:
  1. Begin with executive summary highlighting key indicators
  2. Organize into logical sections: Risk Assessment, Financial Impact, Recommendations
  3. Convert raw metrics into business narratives with strategic context
  4. Use executive-level, decision-focused language throughout
  5. Include brief summary with recommended strategic actions
```

### Advanced Search Configuration

**✅ Production Pattern:**
```yaml
resources:
  max_results: 10
  experimental:
    Diversity:
      GroupBy: ["DOCUMENT_TYPE"]
      MaxResults: 3
    RerankWeights:
      TopicalityMultiplier: 4
      EmbeddingMultiplier: 1.2
      RerankingMultiplier: 1.5
```

### Model Configuration

**✅ Add for Production:**
```yaml
agent:
  models:
    orchestration: "auto"  # Enable automatic optimization
```

## Agent Configuration

Agents are configured in YAML files with:
- **Tools**: Cortex Analyst, Cortex Search, custom functions
- **Instructions**: Response behavior and orchestration logic
- **Sample Questions**: Example queries for users
- **Resources**: Semantic views, search services, databases
- **Models**: Orchestration optimization settings

## Integration with dbt

The dbt pipeline creates the **data foundation**:
- ✅ Semantic views (for Cortex Analyst)
- ✅ Cortex Search services (for document search)
- ✅ Parsed documents and data models

Agents **consume** these resources but are managed separately for operational flexibility.

## Current Agents

## Deployment Requirements

### Permissions Setup
```bash
# Required for SNOWFLAKE_INTELLIGENCE database access
snow sql -q "
GRANT ROLE SNOWFLAKE_INTELLIGENCE_ADMIN_RL TO ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE SNOWFLAKE_INTELLIGENCE TO ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
"
```

### Database Structure
```bash
# Ensure proper schema exists
snow sql -q "
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS SNOWFLAKE_INTELLIGENCE;
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS SNOWFLAKE_INTELLIGENCE.AGENTS;
"
```

## Future Agents

The configuration supports adding new agents for different business domains:
- **HR Intelligence Agent**: Employee performance and workforce analytics
- **Finance Intelligence Agent**: Financial performance and budgeting
- **Operations Intelligence Agent**: Operational efficiency and process optimization

Each agent can have its own tools, instructions, and data sources while sharing the same management infrastructure.
