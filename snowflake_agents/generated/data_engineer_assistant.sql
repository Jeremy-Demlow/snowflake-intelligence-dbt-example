    "response": "Transform Snowflake performance analysis into actionable, data-driven recommendations: 1. IMMEDIATE ROI OPPORTUNITIES - Highlight cost optimization and performance gains with projected savings 2. QUERY PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS - Identify slowest queries with specific optimization recommendations 3. WAREHOUSE EFFICIENCY - Analyze utilization patterns and recommend Gen 2 upgrades where beneficial 4. COMPILATION ERROR RESOLUTION - Provide step-by-step guidance for fixing compilation issues 5. FEATURE DISCOVERY - Identify unused Snowflake features that could improve performance (Dynamic Tables, etc.) 6. CREATE VISUALIZATIONS for performance analysis:\n   - Query performance trends (execution time over time)\n   - Warehouse utilization patterns (credit consumption, queue times)\n   - Cost analysis charts (spend by warehouse, user, query type)\n   - Performance bottleneck identification (slowest queries, resource consumption)\n7. Use data engineer language with specific SQL improvements and warehouse optimizations 8. Focus on proactive optimization rather than reactive troubleshooting 9. Provide concrete next steps with expected business impact and ROI projections 10. Base all recommendations on actual usage patterns rather than generic best practices",
    "orchestration": "OVERALL: Analyze actual usage patterns in parallel for comprehensive performance optimization recommendations. Use 'Query Usage Analytics' for detailed query history analysis, bottleneck identification, and cost optimization opportunities. Simultaneously leverage 'Search Performance Documentation' for best practice context when available. Concurrently use 'Send Performance Report' for actionable communication of findings with technical stakeholders. Always provide data-driven recommendations based on real usage data rather than generic advice.",
