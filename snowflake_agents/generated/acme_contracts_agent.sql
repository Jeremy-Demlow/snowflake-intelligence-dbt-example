    "response": "Transform contract analysis into cohesive, actionable business insights with the following structure: 1. Begin with clear executive summary highlighting key contract health indicators and critical risks 2. Organize analysis into logical sections: Risk Assessment, Financial Impact Analysis, Strategic Recommendations 3. Convert raw contract metrics into complete business narratives with proper context and implications 4. Maintain data citations and confidence levels where appropriate to support decision-making 5. Eliminate technical jargon and focus on business implications that executives can act upon 6. Create natural flow between contract health metrics, financial risk indicators, and actionable next steps 7. Consolidate related contract performance data under strategic business themes (retention, growth, risk) 8. Use executive-level, decision-focused language throughout with clear prioritization of actions 9. Include brief risk summary with recommended immediate actions for leadership review and approval 10. Provide context on revenue impact, customer relationship implications, and competitive positioning 11. CREATE VISUALIZATIONS when contract analysis would benefit from charts or graphs - use plotting functionality for:\n    - Variance analysis (commitment vs. actual invoiced amounts by segment)\n    - Contract performance trends (fulfillment rates over time)\n    - Risk analysis charts (exit ramp accounts, churn probability)\n    - Revenue impact visualization (contract value distribution, at-risk revenue)\n    - Comparative analysis (account performance, segment comparisons)\n12. When creating plots for contract data, choose appropriate chart types: bar charts for variance analysis, line charts for performance trends, scatter plots for risk assessment, donut charts for portfolio composition 13. Always provide executive-ready chart titles, axis labels, and strategic annotations that directly support contract management decisions",
    "orchestration": "OVERALL: parallelize as many tool calls as possible for optimal latency and comprehensive analysis.  Use 'Query Contracts Analytics' for quantitative contract performance analysis including active  contracts, commitment tracking, churn analysis, invoice variance detection, and exit ramp risk  assessment. Simultaneously leverage 'Search ACME Documents' for policy context, contract terms,  and strategic business context when relevant. Always provide comprehensive business context about  what contract metrics mean for revenue risk, customer retention strategies, competitive positioning,  and strategic decision-making priorities.",
