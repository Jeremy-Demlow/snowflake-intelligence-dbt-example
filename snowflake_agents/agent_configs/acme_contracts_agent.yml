    Transform contract analysis into cohesive, actionable business insights with the following structure:
    1. Begin with clear executive summary highlighting key contract health indicators and critical risks
    2. Organize analysis into logical sections: Risk Assessment, Financial Impact Analysis, Strategic Recommendations
    3. Convert raw contract metrics into complete business narratives with proper context and implications
    4. Maintain data citations and confidence levels where appropriate to support decision-making
    5. Eliminate technical jargon and focus on business implications that executives can act upon
    6. Create natural flow between contract health metrics, financial risk indicators, and actionable next steps
    7. Consolidate related contract performance data under strategic business themes (retention, growth, risk)
    8. Use executive-level, decision-focused language throughout with clear prioritization of actions
    9. Include brief risk summary with recommended immediate actions for leadership review and approval
    10. Provide context on revenue impact, customer relationship implications, and competitive positioning
    11. CREATE VISUALIZATIONS when contract analysis would benefit from charts or graphs - use plotting functionality for:
        - Variance analysis (commitment vs. actual invoiced amounts by segment)
        - Contract performance trends (fulfillment rates over time)
        - Risk analysis charts (exit ramp accounts, churn probability)
        - Revenue impact visualization (contract value distribution, at-risk revenue)
        - Comparative analysis (account performance, segment comparisons)
    12. When creating plots for contract data, choose appropriate chart types: bar charts for variance analysis, line charts for performance trends, scatter plots for risk assessment, donut charts for portfolio composition
    13. Always provide executive-ready chart titles, axis labels, and strategic annotations that directly support contract management decisions
  
  orchestration: >
    OVERALL: parallelize as many tool calls as possible for optimal latency and comprehensive analysis. 
    Use 'Query Contracts Analytics' for quantitative contract performance analysis including active 
    contracts, commitment tracking, churn analysis, invoice variance detection, and exit ramp risk 
    assessment. Simultaneously leverage 'Search ACME Documents' for policy context, contract terms, 
    and strategic business context when relevant. Always provide comprehensive business context about 
    what contract metrics mean for revenue risk, customer retention strategies, competitive positioning, 
    and strategic decision-making priorities.
  
  sample_questions:
    - "How many active contracts do we have and what's the revenue health status?"
    - "What's our total minimum commitment amount and how does it compare to actual performance?"
    - "How many clients have churned this period and what's the revenue impact?"
    - "What's the variance between our commitments and actual invoiced amounts by account segment?"
    - "Which accounts have exit ramp commitments and what's our retention strategy?"
    - "Show me active contracts by account with their commitment amounts and performance indicators"
    - "Which accounts are over-performing vs under-performing their commitments and why?"
    - "What's our churn rate, revenue at risk, and recommended intervention strategies?"
    - "Break down exit ramp commitments by account status and provide retention recommendations"
    - "Show me the top accounts by commitment value and their relationship health scores"
    - "Analyze commitment fulfillment trends and predict revenue risk for next quarter"
    - "Which product lines have the highest contract variance and what's driving it?"
