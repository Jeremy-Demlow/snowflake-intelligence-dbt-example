===============================
Document ID: HVAC-INST-2024-V2.1
Last Updated: March 2024

OVERVIEW
--------
This manual provides step-by-step procedures for installing residential and light commercial HVAC systems. All installations must comply with local codes and manufacturer specifications.

PRE-INSTALLATION CHECKLIST
--------------------------
□ Building permits obtained and approved
□ Load calculations completed and verified
□ Equipment delivery confirmed (indoor/outdoor units)
□ Site inspection completed for:
  - Adequate clearances
  - Proper electrical supply
  - Gas line connections (if applicable)
  - Condensate drain access
  - Ductwork routing

INDOOR UNIT INSTALLATION
------------------------
1. LOCATION REQUIREMENTS:
   - Minimum 24" service clearance on control side
   - Level platform or suspended properly  
   - Away from high-traffic areas
   - Access to electrical supply and drain

2. MOUNTING PROCEDURES:
   - Use vibration isolators for all connections
   - Secure to structural members (16" o.c. minimum)
   - Ensure proper refrigerant line routing
   - Install service disconnect within sight

3. ELECTRICAL CONNECTIONS:
   - Verify voltage matches unit nameplate
   - Use copper wire rated for temperature
   - Install dedicated circuit with proper overcurrent protection
   - Ground all components per NEC requirements

OUTDOOR UNIT INSTALLATION  
-------------------------
1. PAD PREPARATION:
   - Level concrete pad (4" minimum thickness)
   - Proper drainage away from unit
   - Minimum clearances: 30" service side, 12" other sides
   - 60" minimum clearance above unit

2. REFRIGERANT LINE INSTALLATION:
   - Use ACR copper tubing only
   - Properly insulate suction line
   - Support every 6-8 feet
   - Nitrogen purge during brazing
   - Pressure test before charging

3. START-UP PROCEDURES:
   - Verify all connections tight
   - Check refrigerant charge using superheat/subcooling
   - Test all safety controls
   - Verify proper airflow (CFM measurements)
   - Document all settings and pressures

COMMISSIONING CHECKLIST
-----------------------
□ System operates in all modes (heat/cool/fan)
□ Temperatures within design parameters
□ No unusual noises or vibrations  
□ Customer walkthrough completed
□ Warranty registration submitted
□ Service schedule explained to customer

TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON ISSUES
-----------------------------
• Low airflow: Check filter, ductwork restrictions
• Short cycling: Verify charge, check controls
• High operating pressures: Check condenser coil, fan operation
• Customer complaints about comfort: Verify load calculations

All installations require final inspection and customer sign-off before completion.
